 I see different ways of declaring / outputing class objects uin JS i.e. ``export default new StopPointClient();`` at end of file or ``export default class Rook `` at the begining.
   - is it becasue JS revisions or there is a deper reason behind it? 
   - is there a best practise on how to declare class objects?
